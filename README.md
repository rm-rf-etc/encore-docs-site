encore-docs-site
================

The source for [encore.jit.su](//www.encore.jit.su).

This site avoids use of static content such as images and stylesheets to make publishing on nodejitsu easy.
You would otherwise add a `public` directory in the root of the project and configure a server like nginx
to server whatever media you have there, be it styles, images, fonts, flash files, etc.
